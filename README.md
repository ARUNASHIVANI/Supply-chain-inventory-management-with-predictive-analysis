# Supply-chain-inventory-management-with-predictive-analysis
A dedicated, single-page application built in PHP and MySQL to provide instant, actionable insights into the supply chain's inventory health. This dashboard consolidates critical metrics and visualizes immediate stock-out risks to support rapid decision-making.🎯 GoalTo provide Supply Chain managers and executives with a clear, high-level summary of inventory liquidity and impending risks, focusing on Total Inventory Value, Product Status, and Critical Alert Volumes.✨ Key Features & Functionality1. Unified Risk MonitoringThe dashboard replaces lengthy alert lists with clear quantitative metrics and a visual summary:KPI Cards: Track the current monetary Total Inventory Value, Active Product Count, and two critical risk indicators:Below Reorder Point: Static risk measure (stock $\le$ reorder point).Critical Alerts (Total): Dynamic risk measure based on system-generated (predictive) warnings.Risk Visualization: Utilizes Chart.js to render a clear bar graph comparing the volume of the two critical risk types, allowing users to quickly assess which risk dimension is currently more dominant.2. Data Integrity & CleanupA critical database maintenance routine is executed on load:Stale Alert Deletion: The system automatically identifies and deletes records in the alerts table that reference product_ids no longer present in the inventory table. This ensures the Critical Alerts count is always accurate and relevant.⚙️ Technical RequirementsComponentMinimum VersionNotesBackendPHP 7.4+Requires mysqli extension.DatabaseMySQL / MariaDBAll data operations are handled via raw SQL queries.FrontendHTML5, CSSUses Chart.js (CDN) for dynamic graphing.IconographyFont Awesome 6Used for KPI icons and sidebar navigation.🚀 Setup Guide1. Database Connection (db.php)Ensure you have a file named db.php in your root directory containing your secure database credentials.PHP// db.php (Example)
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "scm_user";
$password = "your_secure_password";
$dbname = "scm_inventory_db";
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
2. Database SchemaThe dashboard relies on key columns for its reporting. Verify your tables match these requirements:inventory table: Must include stock_level, unit_price, and reorder_point.alerts table: Must include product_id (foreign key to inventory.id) and type (used to filter for 'Critical').3. DeploymentPlace all project files (dashboard.php, db.php, style.css, etc.) within your web server's document root (e.g., /var/www/html/scm_dashboard/).Access the application at: http://[your_server_ip]/scm_dashboard/dashboard.php🧩 Usage & MaintenanceData FlowPHP Execution: dashboard.php connects to MySQL via db.php.Cleanup: Executes the DELETE query to remove stale alerts.Data Fetching: Runs four separate SELECT SUM/COUNT queries to gather KPI values.Client-Side Rendering: The fetched PHP variables ($critical_alerts, $below_reorder_count) are JSON-encoded and injected into the HTML.
